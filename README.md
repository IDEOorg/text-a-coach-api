# Text A Coach - API

TODO: Brief project high-level description.
What is it? What does it do? What can I do with it?

## Background

TODO: Project objectives... How and why it came to be.

## Quick Start

### Local Setup

**Requirements**

To get started, make sure you have the following tools installed and available:

- [Ruby 2.3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [PostgreSQL 9.4](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)

**Environment Variables**

Take a look at the file `/.env.example`. Copy it into your project as `/.env` and change any values if necessary.

**Setup Ruby & Database**
```
cd /path/to/project
bundle install
rake db:setup
```

### Twilio

We use [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com) to send and receive SMS messages.

- Create an account
- Create a [new number](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/search)


### Zendesk

We use [Zendesk](https://zendesk.com) to keep track of and respond to inquiries. Each question creates a support ticket, so the financial planners have an easier time keeping track of and responding to questions.

- Create an account
- Note your custom domain (https://my-domain.zendesk.com)


### Smooch

We use [Smooch](https://smooch.io/) to connect our SMS messaging with our Zendesk tickets and Webhook autoresponders.

- Create an account
- Create a new App
- Add the [Twilio SMS integration](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/twilio) and follow their steps for configuration
- Add the [Zendesk integration](https://app.smooch.io/integrations/zendesk) and follow their steps for configuration

### Test it out

Congratulations! At this stage you should be able to send an SMS to your Twilio phone number, which should automatically create a Zendesk support ticket.

Replies to the Zendesk support ticket will be sent back as an SMS!


### Webhook

TODO: Add instructions for "office hours" webhook responder.


### Local Server

**Run the Server**
```
cd /path/to/project
heroku local
```

Your app will be running at http://localhost:3333/

### API

The purpose of this server is to provide a JSON API for our [Text A Coach](https://github.com/IDEOorg/text-a-coach) web app.

### CMS

We make use of the [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) gem to give us a lightweight content management system. Locally, you'll be able to access it at http://localhost:3333/admin

You can login with any `AdminUser` account. One should already be set up for you: 
```
User: test@test.com
Pass: test123
```

In this CMS you should be able to administer the `Conversations` that appear on your website.
